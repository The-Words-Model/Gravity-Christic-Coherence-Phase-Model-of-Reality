# ✝️ The Christic Metric Tensor

The Christic Metric Tensor reframes spacetime geometry as a **coherence response structure** governed by obedience-phase alignment to the Christic Coherence Phase Field (Φc). It encodes not only spacetime curvature, but also moral gradient, coherence integrity, and divine boundary conditions.

## 🔷 1. Foundational Equation

Let the **Christic Wavefunction** be:

$$
\Psi(\theta) = e^{i\theta}
$$

Where:

- $\theta$ is the **obedience phase**,
- $d\Psi/d\theta = i\Psi$: coherence gradient under alignment,
- $\theta \rightarrow 0$: perfect coherence (Christ), unity,
- $\theta \rightarrow \pi$: disobedient mirror (fallen phase), fragmentation.

## 🧭 2. Christic Metric Tensor Definition

We define the Christic metric $g_{\mu\nu}^{(\theta)}$ as:

$$
g_{\mu\nu}^{(\theta)} = \Phi_c^2(\theta) \cdot \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}
$$

Where:

- $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ is the **baseline spacetime geometry** (e.g., Minkowski or GR metric),
- $\Phi_c(\theta)$ is the **Christic Coherence Phase Field**, a scalar conformal factor,
- $\Phi_c(\theta) = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta) = e^{i\theta}$ (unit modulus, moral phase encoded),
- The **Christic correction** modulates geometry according to alignment with Christ.

## 🌀 3. Obedience-Curvature Coupling

We define obedience curvature coupling $\Lambda(\theta)$ as:

$$
\Lambda(\theta) = \frac{d^2\Psi}{d\theta^2} = -\Psi(\theta)
$$

This gives:

- Constructive coherence (gravity): $\theta = 0 \Rightarrow \Lambda = -1$
- Destructive coherence (dark tension): $\theta = \pi \Rightarrow \Lambda = +1$
- Neutral (mass): $\theta = \pi/2 \Rightarrow \Lambda = 0$

Thus, $\Lambda(\theta)$ tracks **moral curvature**, not mere energy density.

## 🌌 4. Obedience-Gradient Tensor

We define a **phase derivative tensor** $C_{\mu\nu}$ as:

$$
C_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu \theta \cdot \partial_\nu \theta
$$

And the full Christic metric:

$$
g_{\mu\nu}^{(\theta)} = \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} + \kappa \cdot C_{\mu\nu}
$$

Where:

- $\kappa$ is a Christic coupling constant (obedience sensitivity),
- $C_{\mu\nu}$ reflects coherence strain due to deviation from Christ.

## 💫 5. Divergence Coherence Principle

The divergence of the Christic Coherence Field encodes gravitational regulation:

$$
\nabla^\mu \nabla_\mu \Phi_c(\theta) = -\Lambda(\theta) \cdot \Phi_c(\theta)
$$

Which implies:

- Obedience suppresses divergence → gravitational unification.
- Disobedience increases divergence → decoherence and spacetime fragmentation.

The Christic Metric is not just physical—it is theological: reality coheres only in alignment with Christ Jesus, who is both the Origin and Sustainer of all space, time, and truth.
